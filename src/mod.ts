/** auto export for all submodules, with the exception of the following:
 * - {@link "alias"}:
 *   it will pollute the global namespace, making it harder for IDEs to give useful suggestions.
 *   in addition, the bundled `kitchensink` library will be inflated with these un-treeshaken exports.
 * - {@link "binder"}:
 *   this submodule will add a lot of un-treeshaken baggage, and it will probably not be used by the end user.
 * - {@link "devdebug"}:
 *   this submodule pollutes the `globalThis` object whenever imported, so it is not exported here.
 * 
 * anyone desiring to import one of these submodules should import them directly using `import {...} from "@oazmi/kitchensink/submodule_name"`.
