/** a submodule for cross-runtime environment utility functions.
 * 
 * the functions in this submodule do not place a "hard" dependency on the runtime environments.
 * instead, the various runtime-globals are defined as "soft" objects/symbols which may or may not exist.
 * as a result, some of the functions (such as {@link getRuntime}) are very weakly/generically typed,
 * and their results are not narrowed based on your input arguments.
 * the advantage of such is that this submodule will not choke your LSP.
 * not to mention that you'll probably be aware of what runtime you're working with anyway,
 * so you can always use the `as` assertions to confine the return value to a certain runtime's feature.
 * 
 * for most functions in here, you will need to provide the {@link RUNTIME} enum that you are querying for.
 * 
 * to identify your script's current {@link RUNTIME} environment, you'd want to use the {@link identifyCurrentRuntime} function.
 * 
 * > [!important]
 * > when using a bundler like `esbuild`, if you place a dependency on this submodule,
 * > you **will** have to declare `"node:child_process"` and `"node:fs/promises"` in your array of `external` dependencies.
 * > because otherwise, your bundler will complain about not being able to find these imports.
 * > alternatively, you can also set the `platform` to `"node"`, so that the bundler will treat imports with the `"node:"` prefix as external.
 * 
 * TODO: additional features to add in the future:
 * - [x] filesystem read/writing on system runtimes (deno, bun, and node).
 * - [ ] filesystem read/writing on web/extension runtimes will use the browser's FileAccess API (and prompt the user to select the folder)
 * - [ ] filesystem read/writing on web/extension runtimes will use `window.navigator.storage.getDirectory()`.
 *       and for web workers, we may use `self.navigator.storage.getDirectory()` instead.
 * - [ ] persistent key-value storage: such as `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` or `chrome.storage.sync` or kv-storage of `window.navigator.storage.persist()`.
 *       copy these from your github-aid browser extension project.
 * - [x] system environment variables.
 * - [x] shell/commandline/terminal command execution.
 * - [x] subprocess command execution.
 * - [x] add a function for querying the operating system's platform and architecture.
 * - [ ] (breaking change) consider using a class based approach to calling these functions as methods,
 *       where the currently selected runtime will be known by the class instance,
 *       so that the user will not have to pass down which runtime they are querying for all the time.
 * - [ ] (RISKY) add a `setEnvVariable` function.
 *       but it may corrupt the user's variables if they're not careful, so I don't want to implement it unless I find myself needing it.
 * - [ ] (EASY) add `copyEntry` and `moveEntry` for copying and moving filesystem entries on system-bound runtimes.
