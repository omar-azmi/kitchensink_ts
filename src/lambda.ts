/** curry a function `fn`, with optional `thisArg` option for binding as the `this`-object.
 * 
 * what is currying? it allows a multi-parameter function to be transformed into a higher order function that always takes one argument,
 * and spits out another function which also take only one argument, and so on... until all parameters have been filled,
 * upon which the final function finally evaluates into the return value (type parameter {@link R} in this case).
 * 
 * note that this function relies on `fn.length` property to identify the number of **required** arguments taken by `fn`.
 * this means that default valued arguments (such as `c` in `fn: (a: number, b: number, c = 5) => number`), or rest/spread
 * arguments (such as `args` in `fn: (a: number, b: number, ...args: number[]) => number`), are not considered as required,
 * and thus do not increment the count of `fn.length`.
 * 
 * currying is usually poorly implemented through the use of closure.
 * for instance:
 * 
 * ```ts ignore
 * const curried_fn = ((arg0) => (arg1) => (arg2) => fn(arg1, arg2, arg3))
 * const output = curried_fn("arg0")("arg1")("arg2")
 * ```
 * 
 * this is bad because when you evaluate a curry with N-parameters, you also have to make N-calls (albeit it being tail-calls),
 * instead of just one call, should you have had all the parameters from the beginning.
 * not to mention that all javascript engines famously do not perform tail-call optimizations.
 * 
 * so here, I've implemented currying using the `bind` method, which means that once all parameters are filled, the function goes through only one call (no overheads).
 * the same example from before would translate into the following when binding is used:
 * 
 * ```ts ignore
 * const thisArg = undefined
 * const curried_fn = fn.bind(thisArg, arg0).bind(thisArg, arg1).bind(thisArg, arg2)
 * const output = curried_fn("arg0")("arg1")("arg2")
 * ```
 * 
 * do note that it is very possible for the javascript engine to internally create tail-recursion closure for every argument binding,
 * resulting in the same unoptimized function that we discredited just a while ago.
 * without benchmarking, I cannot say for sure which implementation is more performant.
 * 
 * @param fn the function to curry
 * @param thisArg provide an optional argument to use as the `this` object inside of `fn`
 * @returns a series of single argument partial functions that does not evaluate until all parameters have been provided
 * 
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { assertEquals as assertEq } from "jsr:@std/assert"
 * 
 * const abcd = (a: number, b: string, c: boolean, d: symbol): string => (String(a) + b + String(c) + " " + String(d))
