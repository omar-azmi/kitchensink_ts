/** the submodules in this category export customizable cross-runtime network connection protocols,
 * such as http clients, udp clients, and tcp clients.
 * in addition, it also exports some utility functions related to http request and response manipulation.
 * 
 * essentially, to utilize all submodules, you might need some kind of wrapper over your network's connection-primitive objects.
 * 
 * do note that most of the exported constructs are not intended for the web, but rather for standalone js-runtimes
 * (whether acting as a server, or a client, or even just a peer connecting to another peer).
