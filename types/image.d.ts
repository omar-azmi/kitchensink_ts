 * due to the fact that this function utilizes a `canvas`, it is important to note that the output `ImageData` is sometimes lossy in nature,
 * because gpu-accelarated web-browsers *approximate* the colors, and also due to rounding errors from/to internal float-valued colors and output
 * integer-valued colors. <br>
 * but generally speaking, the `ImageData` can be lossless if all of the following are satisfied:
 * - disable gpu-acceleration of your web-browser, through the `flags` page
 * - your `img` source has either no alpha-channel, or 100% visible alpha-channel throughout (ie non-transparent image)
 * - you have pre-multiplied alpha disabled (this part can be achieved by this library, but I havn't looked into it yet)
 * @param img an image source can be an `HTMLImageElement`, `HTMLCanvasElement`, `ImageBitmap`, etc..
 * @param crop_rect dimension of the cropping rectangle. leave as `undefined` if you wish not to crop, or only provide a partial {@link Rect}

 * @param channels number of color channels (ie: bytes per pixel). for instance, you'd use `4` for RGBA, `3` for RGB, `1` for L, `2` for AL, etc...
 * @param alpha_channel specify which channel is the alpha channel, or leave it as `undefined` to dictate lack of thereof. for instance, you'd use `3` for RGB**A**, `0` for **A**L, and `undefined` for RGB
 * @param alpha_bias if alpha is present, you can specify the minimum alpha value required for the pixel to be visible. anything less will make the pixel dull

/** get the bounding box {@link Rect} of an image, based on an accumulative `padding_condition` function that should return
 * `0.0` for padding/whitespace/empty pixels, and positive numbers (usually `1.0`) for non-padding/important pixels. <br>
 * if the summation of `padding_condition` applied onto a particular row, or column of pixels is less than
 * `minimum_non_padding_value`, then that entire row/column will be counted as an empty padding space. <br>
 * else if the summation of `padding_condition` is greater than `minimum_non_padding_value`, then that specific
 * row/column will be counted as one of the bounding box's sides. <br>
 * take a look at {@link trimImagePadding} to get an understanding of a potential use case. <br>
 * you do not need to specify the number of channels in your `img_data`, because it will be calculated automatically
 * via `img_data.width`, `img_data.height`, and `img_data.data.length` <br>
 * ### a note on performance
 * almost all performance depends purely on the complexity of your `padding_condition` <br>
 * if the equations in `padding_condition` use square-roots, exponents, if conditions, then expect a major performance drop <br>
 * if your equations consist only of `+, -, *, /`, then the performance will be much faster. <br>
 * I've benchmarked this function, and defining `rowAt`, `colAt`, and `nonPaddingValue` outside of this function, instead of
 * inlining them makes no difference. <br>
 * also, substituting `padding_condition` in `nonPaddingValue` with the actual arithmetic function via inlining (and thus
 * avoiding constant function calls) makes no difference, thanks to JIT doing the inlining on its own in V8. <br>
 * finally, the `colAt` inline function is suprisingly super fast (close to `rowAt`). and so, bounding top and bottom
 * is not at all visibly quicker than bounding left and right.
